# Programming-And-Data-Structures

Programming and Data Strucutres : by Prof. N.S Narayanaswamy, IIT Madras

      This is a course about the design and usage of different data structures to make programming  error-free.  C is used as the programming language for designing  data structures and instantiating them in our programs. 

      It is assumed that the student is atleast comfortable with the C programming language and is willing to learn and practice as the course progresses. 

My Vision : 
While(Programming and Data Structures)
    { 
          Practice Programming;
    }
Programming is Pleasure;
Enjoy Programming;
